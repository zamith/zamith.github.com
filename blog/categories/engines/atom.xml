    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first time I created a Rails Engine, there were some parts of it that were confusing as it was just like a Rails App, but no quite, just like a gem, but not quite. There was a lot of digging through old or non existing documentation about how to configure an engine I've just created.</p>

<p>Nowadays with the rising popularity of engines, the documentation is getting better, still there are always some little things I have to do every time I create a new engine. Since this is boring work, I decided to create a gem to do this boilerplate work for me. And thus, <a href="http://github.com/zamith/mechanic">Mechanic</a> was born!</p>

<p>This idea is largely based on thoughtbot's <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders">Suspenders</a> that tries to do the same thing for normal apps. Mechanic is very new and still a diamond in a rough, so if you spot a bug or have a feature you would like added please let me now in Mechanic <a href="https://github.com/zamith/mechanic/issues">github issues page</a>.</p>
